#Customer Support Chat Sentiment Analysis

This project explores AI-related methods of customer dissatisfaction detection during customer support chats. It is the applied part of a research thesis to the MSc in Artificial Intelligence to the Irish National College.

##Project Objective

The objective is to categorize messages of customers as either satisfied or dissatisfied with a number of conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches. The paper examines various types of data representation, like raw text, BERT embeddings, PCA-reduced vectors as well as performance of models in different approaches.
